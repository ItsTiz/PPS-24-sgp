# Implementation - Tiziano Vuksan

We divided the work to play to our strengths and keep things organized.

- I took charge of the `controller` package and handled `simulation`, `tracks`, `utils`, and `weather` within the `model` package.
- For the `view` package I covered `SimulationDisplay` and `CliDisplay` part.
- For the `race` package, I handled race `physics`.
- The launcher was a joint effort, with both of us contributing.
