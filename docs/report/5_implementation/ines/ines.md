# Implementation - Ines Fraccalvieri

We divided the work to play to our strengths and keep things organized.

- I focused on the `view` package (except for `SimulationDisplay` and `CliDisplay`, which were done by Tiziano) and covered `car`, `common`, and `driver` in the `model` package.
- For the `race` package, I worked on the `scoreboard` while Tiziano handled race physics.
- The `Launcher` and `CarState` were a joint effort, with both of us contributing.
- I worked also in the controller to enable communication with the view by adding the `SimulationConfigListener`.
