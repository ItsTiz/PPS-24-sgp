## Sprint review

For the features present in the product backlog, the initial implementations have been created for the Car Model, Driver Model, and Track Model items. For each of these, a class has been created, along with the related tests and the Scala doc.

The Scoreboard item has been postponed to future sprints until a complete picture of the necessary entities for its composition is available.
