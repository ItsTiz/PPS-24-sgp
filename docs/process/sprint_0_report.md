## Definition of DONE

We consider a task or subtask "DONE":

*   For the **model** part of the project: the part of model involved in the "task" allows compiation and **must** pass all tests written while implementing it (using TDD methodology).
*   For the **view** part: the view **must be usable** (no pending buttons or empty "painting fields") and properly connected to the **model** (use TDD wherever possible**)**.

**In addition to this, there need to be ScalaDoc documentation.**
