# PPS24-25: ScalaGP

ScalaGP Simulator is a Formula 1-inspired racing simulation project developed in Scala.
It models a full race environment including drivers, cars, tires, weather and strategies.
The simulation visualizes races on a custom track, where cars move based on predefined mechanics such as speed,
fuel consumption, tire degradation, and sector grip.
